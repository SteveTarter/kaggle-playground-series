# Kaggle Playground Series

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks and data for Kaggle's Playground Series of machine learning challenges.  To quote Kaggle:

"The goal of the Tabular Playground Series is to provide the Kaggle community with a variety of fairly light-weight challenges that can be used to learn and sharpen skills in different aspects of machine learning and data science. The duration of each competition will generally only last a few weeks, and may have longer or shorter durations depending on the challenge. The challenges will generally use fairly light-weight datasets that are synthetically generated from real-world data, and will provide an opportunity to quickly iterate through various model and feature engineering ideas, create visualizations, etc."

## Repository Organization

The repository is organized by year, then contest.  As a contest begins, a new subdirectory will be created in a branch for that contest.  In that way, I hope to maintain the various versions in a manner similar to how it is on Kaggle.  Note that the first contest is already in the books as this repository is being established, so it doesn't follow this structure.
